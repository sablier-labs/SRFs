<!--
  This is the suggested template for new SRFs. After you have filled in the requisite fields, please delete these comments.

  Note that an SRF number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SRF, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `eip-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

  The title should be 44 characters or less. It should not repeat the SRF number in title, irrespective of the category.

## Abstract

<!--
  The Abstract is a technical summary in a short paragraph. This should be a terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The motivation section should include a description of any nontrivial problems the SRF solves. It should not describe how the SRF solves those problems, unless it is not immediately obvious. It should not describe why the SRF should be made into a standard, unless it is not immediately obvious.

## Prior Art

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The Prior Art section should provide a brief analysis of other similar standards or proposals, for example, in EIPs. It should identify and credit similar standards, and describe how this SRF differs from those other standards.

## Specification

<!--
  The Specification section should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Sablier platforms.

  It is recommended to follow RFC 2119 and RFC 8170. Do not remove the key word definitions if RFC 2119 and RFC 8170 are followed.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting
-->

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

## Rationale

<!--
  The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

TBD

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--

  This section is optional.

  All SRFs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The SRF author must explain how to deal with these incompatibilities. SRF submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting
-->

No backward compatibility issues found.

## Example Implementation

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The Example Implementation section should include a minimal implementation that assists in understanding or implementing this specification. It should not include project build files. The example is not a replacement for the Specification section, and the proposal should still be understandable without it.
  If the example implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../examples/srf-##/`. External links will not be allowed.

## Security Considerations

<!--
  This section is optional.

  Most SRFs should contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. For example, include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed.
