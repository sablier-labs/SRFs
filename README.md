# Sablier Requests for Feedback (SRFs)

This repository contains all the Sablier Requests for Feedback (SRFs) that have been submitted by the community. The
purpose of these requests is to standardize and provide high-quality documentation for the Sablier protocol.

Standards in this repository may be in various stages of development. Use of draft standards and feedback on the
proposed standards is encouraged.

If you don't find what you're looking for, feel free to create an issue and propose a new SRF!
